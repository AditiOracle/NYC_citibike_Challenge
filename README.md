**Overview of the analysis:** We are working on project to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, we have done our analysis on a bike trip analysis on NYC bike ride data of August 2019.

First we converted the &quot;tripduration&quot; column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we created a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

At last, I created the story using the dashboards I have created to see the Target Audience in our whole project.

**Results:**

1. ![Checkout Times for Users](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Time_for_Users.png)

Maximum Users are checking the bikes for approximately 30-40 minutes. Few hundreds are checking out for 1 hour or more.

1. ![Checkout times by Gender](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_by_Gender.png)

Most of the Males are checking out the bikes for 1 hr.

295 males checkout the bike for 1 hr. Few hundred or less than that male, female and unknown users are checking out the bikes for 2 or 3 hrs.

1. ![Trips by Weekday per hour](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_weekday_per_hour.png)

We have maximum trips in peak hours of weekday.

7AM-9PM and 5PM-7PM (Mon-Fri) are the busiest time for bike trips.

Thursday is the busiest day of the week.

1. ![Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Trips_by_Gender_weekday_per_hour.png)

Males are riding the bikes maximum during the peak hours of the weekday.

1. ![User Type Trips by Gender by Weekday per hour](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/User%20_Type_trips_by_Gender_weekday.png)

Male Subscribers are using the bike most as compared to the Customer users.

Unknown Customers are using more bikes than Unknown Subscribers

1. ![Bike Utilization](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Bike_Utilization.png)

The bikes with larger bubbles have higher utilization and need our attention. They may need repair or to be replaced by least utilized bikes.

1. ![Average Trip Duration by Age](https://github.com/AditiOracle/NYC_citibike_Challenge/blob/main/Resources/Average_trip_duration_by_age_group.png)

There is a spike in Age Group â€“ (1965-1970) and (2000-2005), may be they are using for their work or school/university because bike trips are maximum in peak hours.

**Summary:**

As per my analysis, mostly the Male Subscribers are using the bike more during the peak hour in weekdays for at least 25-30 minutes.

We also tried to find the maximum utilization of the bikes to see if they need repair or can be replaced with least used bikes.

In addition to that we have the Generation X (1965-1980) and Generation Z (1997-2003) using the bikes most either for their work or school or to stay fit.

**My additional two visualizations**

- **Based on Age Group:**

- **Bike Utilization by Starting Location:**
